A repository for various scripts that do not deserve their own space.

Note
--------

I'm sure there are more efficient ways to accomplish the tasks that these
scripts do. If you see something that you think could be a lot better and
want to let me know, then please do! Otherwise, I hope they're useful to
someone else besides myself.
